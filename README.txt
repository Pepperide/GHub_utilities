GHub Utility tools provide software in order to improve user experience about the usage of Logitech© products.

Update 18/02/2022 v1.0.0:
-   pop-up.py script is able to show the user some informations sent from the Logitech© G HUB© platform.
    Information must be printed on the Windows Debugger using Lua APIs provided by Logitech© 
    (https://douile.github.io/logitech-toggle-keys/APIDocs.pdf. See OutputDebugMessage() function)

Note:
-   If you want to run scripts on startup in Windows, save scripts into the Startup Folder
    (C:\Users\<your_user>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)

-   To hide the console window save the script as .pyw extention instead of .py
